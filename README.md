## Usage

This application was designed as a progressive web application for accessibility and offline access. It allows a user to track their expenses both on and offline and see their updated expenditures once back online.

## Contributing

This was a solo project completed for homework for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. However, this homework deserves a special shout out to Jonathan. Thanks, Jonathan!
